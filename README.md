Physical Seats vs. Virtual Seats
In our BookMyShow project, we distinguish between physical seats and virtual seats.

Physical Seats: These represent actual seats in the venue and are fixed in number, corresponding to the venue's capacity.

Virtual Seats: Conceptual representations within our booking system, allowing patrons to reserve seats for specific showtimes without being tied to a physical location. This flexibility enables patrons to book seats across multiple showtimes.

This distinction ensures efficient management of seating arrangements while offering patrons greater flexibility in booking.
